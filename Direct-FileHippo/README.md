This web-extension makes downloading from FileHippo much easier, 
by adding a direct-link to the full-real (previously hidden) download on the top of the page, 
helping you to avoid downloading that 'malware 3'rd-party downloader' application.

I've basically made this web-extension for myself, and then decided to share it with everyone, because sharing is caring. it's nothing fancy but it is small, quick and it works. If you've enjoyed using it I'll be thrilled to hear all about it in the review section. 

100% free (as beer..), include no ads (I hate those!), does NOT collect any data, includes NO analytics and works entirely offline.
