Developer's HUB / Changelog

1.0.1.8
- removing the usage of 'transform: translateZ(0)' and 'transform: translate3d(0,0,0)' (GPU assisted rendering) since it's too risky for elements (Google-search's query box) that use transition for X/Y/Z position in the page. Not as rare as I thought.. I guess... :|

1.0.1.7
+ include vendor-specific variations to the CSS-rules.

1.0.1.4
* pre-caching HTML scroll-position (CSS only).
* minifying core-actions, removed style-related rules.

1.0.1.3
* modify engine to scroll just the block-level elements + html + body ( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Block-level_elements ), this will help with link-clicking issues.

1.0.1.2
* use just the start stylesheet.
