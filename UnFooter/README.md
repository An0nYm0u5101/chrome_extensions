<h3>★★★★★ Pure CSS, Remove FOOTER-areas from web-pages.</h3>

&gt;footer&lt; areas are useless, space-taking elements (most of the time), 
sometimes they are badly positioned using 'float' rules, which makes them hide parts of the screen, 
hiding them is easy through uBlock-Origin or AdBlock (etc..) but sometimes you don't want to use the 
big ad-blocking extension on sensitive websites (eBay will break very easy...), 
this is a light-weight alternative that simply hides the footer-elements.
