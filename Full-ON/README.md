<h1><img src="resources/icon.png" height="64" width="64"/> Full-ON</h1>

This web-extension helps you to easily enlarge your screen-into a "fullscreen" mode, 
by a simple four-click (or four-taps for mobile devices), 
get it back to "normal mode" by four-clicking again. 

In addition (and this is still "work in progress")
I've researched various ways to also "keep your screen ON" 
a.k.a no dimming/ no shutting down/ no screen-saver/ no power-save mode 
and found (again) various ways (some are hacks, some are legitimate APIs, 
and some are an additions you can only experience on the bleading-edge of trunk/developer build-drivers.


The "prevent screen dimming/sleeping" seems to work find on Chrome (mobile) and older Firefox (mobile) but not newer versions of Firefox (mobile), so... still "work in progress"...

...but at least it is an easy way to get into fullscreen mode in mobile :]


Known Issues:
<ol>
<ul>
double-click used to zoom in-out pages, 
it is also responsible for a problem slowing each click you do in a 300ms.
this is way I'm fixing it by making sure your page includes a proper <code>viewport</code>, 
and the following CSS rule injected:
```css
-webkit-touch-action:   pan-x pan-y pinch-zoom !important;
   -moz-touch-action:   pan-x pan-y pinch-zoom !important;
    -ms-touch-action:   pan-x pan-y pinch-zoom !important;
     -o-touch-action:   pan-x pan-y pinch-zoom !important;
        touch-action:   pan-x pan-y pinch-zoom !important;
-webkit-touch-action:   manipulation !important;
   -moz-touch-action:   manipulation !important;
    -ms-touch-action:   manipulation !important;
     -o-touch-action:   manipulation !important;
        touch-action:   manipulation !important;
```
as a side effect, it should speed-up browsering slightly as well.
</ul>
<ul>
Double-clicking the page often select thumbnails or text.
I am not doing a "prevent default" here!
I'm keeping the original way the browser behave as much as possible, 
if you find (and you'll often would) that double-clicking to go to fullscreen 
also marks something, simple click something else to remove the selection.
</ul>
<ul>
you actually want to double click something but you end up going fullscreen.
this is not a problem, this is the simplest way to implement it (I wondered for a while on tripple-click but I've prefered to kept it simple).
</ul>
<ul>
you've click something instead of a blank part of the page (a link/ a thumnail..). 
simply try to find an empty part of the screen for double-click action.
</ul>
<ul>
The <strong>prevent sleep</strong>/<strong>prevent screen dimming</strong> does not work.
it is a work in progress,
currently I'm mixing some ways to do it using a modified https://github.com/richtr/NoSleep.js
and various other APIs (some old, some new).

see fails and lesson learns in https://github.com/eladkarako/api_awake.git (source-included)
</ul>
</ol>


<strong>When this web-extension will only work partially (not a full API-blocking)?</strong>
Some servers can prevent external-JavaScript from running on their pages, this includes JavaScript from web-extensions. It is usually done by serving the web-page with an additional 'Content-Security-Policy' header with the value 'default-src none', for example (https://addons.mozilla.org does it, and it prevents all, no just mine, web-extensions from working on that sub-domain). There isn't much to do in that matter, Firefox was designed to block web-extensions' JavaScript in those cases (yes, this web-extension's JavaScript too). When ever possible, I add an additional network-filter to each of my web-extension, for an increased security, those will always keep on working.

I've basically made this web-extension for myself, and then decided to share it with everyone, because sharing is caring. it's nothing fancy but it is small, quick and it works. If you've enjoyed using it I'll be thrilled to hear all about it in the review section. 

100% free (as beer..), include no ads (I hate those!), does NOT collect any data, includes NO analytics and works entirely offline.

Developer's HUB / Changelog

1.0.3.5
* additional repeat main method check, with alarms-api.

1.0.3.4
* using 'onclick' on 'window' since it is compatible with touch events.
* not using event-bubble prevention since 'window' is the last chain anyway...
* simplified 'event.detail' checks for tracking-4-clicks-in-a-row.

1.0.3.3
* handling 'click' as an event of 'mouseup' which slightly works better then 'click'.

1.0.3.2
+ adding an updated usage of 'wake-lock API 1.0' from https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/CR-wake-lock-20171214/

1.0.2.6
* adding/fixing feature-policy (both as a HTTP-header and as a META-tag) for wake-lock API.

1.0.2.5
* manipulate 'Content-Security-Policy' (if any exist) to allow media-playing from the web-extension.
* remove 'selections' generated by double/triple-clicks (disconnect/delay with setTimeout).

1.0.2.1
* changed it from double-click to four-clicks, and including prevent-default on the event that will prevent default operations from the browser.
+ changed the way of identifying number of clicks/taps by using default 'event.detail' (removing own 'timeout'-support-click-identification).


1.0.1.8
* experimenting with making the code run in a pure-client-side, since while the code runs fine on Google Chrome (and Chromium) - in the aspect of keeping the screen-ON, Firefox has some sort of nasty over-isolation where the extension-side is 'not as near' to implement on the actuall DOM for some reason. This is an experiment where the main logic actually injected to the DOM in the body of a SCRIPT-element, left in the actual extension-script are few minor tasks and the icon-number-label of the client-side.

1.0.1.6
* improve variable-object creating in the 'feature_fix' part of the code, used to named both 'feature_fix' function and the main usable object (renamed to 'tmp'..).

1.0.1.3
* removing/commenting backend-revealing of objects (used for debug).
* don't pre-assign "placeholder"-functions, just use the 'init' for that.
* init assign function in a Google-closure compatible way (<code>["..name.."]</code>).

1.0.1.2
+ initial (no versioning while product was in-alpha developing :| ).
