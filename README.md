I don't maintain the Firefox/Chrome project-pages anymore, it is a lot of work. <br/>
<br/>
All of the <strong>Chrome web-extension</strong> can be installed by downloading <br/>
your desired web-extension from the releases-section, unzipping it anywhere, <br/>
and loading it through Chrome's developer-mode, as an unpacked web-extension. <br/>
<br/>
All of the <strong>Firefox web-extensions</strong> are <strong>signed with Mozilla</strong>, <br/>
and you can just click the XPI file, click "allow" and click "install", <br/>
directly from the releases-section. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
There is an index, shortly describing (no source) of each web-extension, <br/>
some even with a few screenshots, <br/>
it can access in-here: <a href="https://github.com/eladkarako/chrome_extensions/blob/store/README.md">https://github.com/eladkarako/chrome_extensions/blob/store/README.md</a>.

<br/>
I usually keep the web-extension structure to the bare minimum, <br/>
mostly JavaScript manipulation in client-side, <br/>
and sometimes some pre/post connection filtering. <br/>
Most of my web-extension designed to solve one problem, and they do so quite well. <br/>
