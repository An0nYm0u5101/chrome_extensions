<h1><img src="resources/icon.png" height="64" width="64"/> Chrome-Extension-Real-URL</h1>

<strong>network-resolve a redirect-link (302-redirect) to the direct-link target</strong>, 
from websites that are based on XDA-forums, WordPress, bb-forums, and other PHP-based download-managers, 
essentially - saving you a few clicks and allowing you to copy the link into a download manager.

In most cases links might expire or it can overload the server putting you on hold (especially on XDA).

It makes your browsing experience more secure, by allowing you to see
what is the real target of the link, without actually following it,

This also means you save yourself ads, click-baits any many malicious-contents.

It help you save time, by skipping waiting-screens and download-pages,

You can even copy the real-URL into a multi-part download-managers,
such as FlashGet, JDownloader, Orbit-Downloader or aria2c to download in a much faster-speeds than you were intended to.

More Speed Bonus!
The Real-URL extension follow all of the 301/302 redirect-chains,
It also resolve URLs, so when you'll be finally click the link,
You skip all DNS-resolving, go ahead directly to the final target.

Currently handles:
- All WordPress based-on websites. [for example: APKMirror.com]

<h3>This Extension Is A HUGE Time-Saver!!!</h3>




<strong>When this web-extension will only work partially (not a full API-blocking)?</strong>
Some servers can prevent external-JavaScript from running on their pages, this includes JavaScript from web-extensions. It is usually done by serving the web-page with an additional 'Content-Security-Policy' header with the value 'default-src none', for example (https://addons.mozilla.org does it, and it prevents all, no just mine, web-extensions from working on that sub-domain). There isn't much to do in that matter, Firefox was designed to block web-extensions' JavaScript in those cases (yes, this web-extension's JavaScript too). When ever possible, I add an additional network-filter to each of my web-extension, for an increased security, those will always keep on working.

I've basically made this web-extension for myself, and then decided to share it with everyone, because sharing is caring. it's nothing fancy but it is small, quick and it works. If you've enjoyed using it I'll be thrilled to hear all about it in the review section. 

100% free (as beer..), include no ads (I hate those!), does NOT collect any data, includes NO analytics and works entirely offline.
